# Filament Minder

[My Notes](notes.md)

As a 3D-printing enthusiast, I often switch between different filament types and colors in order to best fit my usage. I might print using flexible TPU filament to print a phone case, and then switch to yellow to print a model of a banana. Many filament spools include a feature that allows you to estimate how much filament you have left, but it is difficult to use and only provides an estimate. Filament minder aims to fix that! I will be creating a website that keeps track of all of your rolls of filament and how much is left on each roll.

## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

> [!NOTE]
>  Fill in this sections as the submission artifact for this deliverable. You can refer to this [example](https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example/blob/main/README.md) for inspiration.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [ ] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [ ] Description of key features
- [ ] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

### Design

![Design image](images/website_sketch.png)

Above is a sketch of what my webpage might look like, created using [ninjamock.com](https://ninjamock.com/home/index). Once you log in, the home page would show your rolls of filament that you have included, and you can select them, read the usage rates, what it was used for, etc. 

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor You
    participant Filament
    participant Website
    You->>Filament: You print, and record how much filament you use.
    Filament->>Website: You enter the roll/color and amount used, website remembers.
```
> [!NOTE]
> TO DO: I need to add a diagram (probably a drawn image) to show how people will interact with the website.
