## Simon Notes

#### Simon-html notes
* Each page of your webpage has a separate .html file, all of which interact
* Adding hyperlinks to other websites and other pages of your webpage seems 1) very easy, and 2) essential to having a good webpage
* Each .html file has a head, a body, and a footer
* It looks like a slash ends the section (i.e. `<head>` starts the head section, and `</head>` ends the head section)
* Indentation seems to be important, which isn't new, but should be noted
* Looks like there are lots of abbreviations that I will need to learn and know off the top of my head

#### Simon-css notes
* Each of the .html files has a corresponding .css file, meaning that you style each page of your webpage individually
* You can add/remove .css styling modularly, meaning you can disable parts of it for a time if you need to
* There are much fewer indentations in .css files; instead, each individual element seems to correspond to a specific code chunk, which stipulates things like color, border, shadow, etc.
* You can select different page elements using the "mouse" button (see image below). I've played around with the inspect portion of a webpage in the past, but I have always searched around in the code until I (hopefully) found what I was looking for. The select tool is much more handy.

#### Simon-react
* The file structure has been cleaned up significantly, it looks like there is a lot of file organization that can happen
* It looks like the react things are created with .jsx files
* Javascript looks like it reads similarly to Python... not exactly the same though, and it needs semicolons
* Based on the language breakdown of the repository, there are *a lot* of files that are written in javascript, which makes sense, as a webpage looks a lot better as the interactivity of the webpage increases
