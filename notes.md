## Simon Notes

#### Simon-html notes
* Each page of your webpage has a separate .html file, all of which interact
* Adding hyperlinks to other websites and other pages of your webpage seems 1) very easy, and 2) essential to having a good webpage
* Each .html file has a head, a body, and a footer
* It looks like a slash ends the section (i.e. <head> starts the head section, and </head> ends the head section)
* Indentation seems to be important, which isn't new, but should be noted
* Looks like there are lots of abbreviations that I will need to learn and know off the top of my head

#### Simon-css notes
* You can use the "mouse" button (see image below) to select different elements of the page. I've played around with the inspect portion of a webpage in the past, but I have always searched around in the code until I (hopefully) found the thing I was looking for. The select tool is much more handy. 
* You can add/remove .css styling modularly, meaning you can disable parts of it for a time if you need to
